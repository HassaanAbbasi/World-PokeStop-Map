# World PokéStops Map
In the game "Pokémon GO", there are many places in the real world that the player can visit to collect virtual items. These places are called "PokéStops". The purpose of this project is to plot some interesting PokéStop locations from around the globe onto a map. Other users are also welcome to add more locations to the map!

## How to
There is an included base "PokeStops.html" map that contains some points. In order to add more locations, open the "PokeGoLocations.csv" file and add its name, latitude, and longitude in accordance with the rest of the entries. Then, run "main.py", which will update "PokeStops.html" with your added places.
